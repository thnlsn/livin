<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

This is livin, an imaginary app that aims to streamline the house hunting process for those looking for their next home. On livin you can browse houses from all over the world, contact the realtor, purchase the property, and own your new home in under a week &ndash; and live in it soon thereafter!

Check it out on your phone or tablet, it's fully responsive!

## Background

This project was built alongside an Advanced CSS & Sass course on uDemy by Jonas Schtedmann. The project included no JavaScript and only pure HTML/CSS (and Sass), however, I built it using React, splitting up each section and their components into react components. As for the CSS/Sass, I made concentrated effort to employ more advanced strategies. For example, I made full use of the power of CSS Grid, particularly auto-fit and auto-fill paired with the minmax() function, as well as purposely not defining row templates to take advantage of CSS Grid's auto-placement algorithm deciding how to deal with implicit grids. This allowed the page to be almost entirely responsive with very few media queries.
